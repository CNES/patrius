/**
 * This interface allows users to add their own differential equations to a numerical propagator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In some cases users may need to integrate some problem-specific equations along with classical spacecraft equations
 * of motions. One example is optimal control in low thrust where adjoint parameters linked to the minimized hamiltonian
 * must be integrated. Another example is formation flying or rendez-vous which use the Clohessy-Whiltshire equations
 * for the relative motion.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface allows users to add such equations to a {@link NumericalPropagator numerical
 * propagator}. Users provide the equations as an implementation of this interface and register it to the propagator
 * thanks to its {@link NumericalPropagator#addAdditionalEquations(AdditionalEquations)} method. Several such objects
 * can be registered with each numerical propagator, but it is recommended to gather in the same object the sets of
 * parameters which equations can interact on each others states.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The additional parameters are gathered in a simple p array. The additional equations compute the pDot array, which is
 * the time-derivative of the p array. Since the additional parameters p may also have an influence on the equations of
 * motion themselves (for example an equation linked to a complex thrust model may induce an acceleration and a mass
 * change), the same {@link TimeDerivativesEquations time derivatives equations adder} already shared by all force
 * models to add their contributions is also provided to the additional equations implementation object. This means
 * these equations can be used as an additional force model if needed. If the additional parameters have no influence at
 * all on the spacecraft state, this adder can simply be ignored.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is the numerical (read not already integrated) counterpart of the
 * {@link fr.cnes.sirius.patrius.propagation.AdditionalStateProvider} interface. It allows to append various additional
 * state parameters to any {@link NumericalPropagator numerical propagator}.
