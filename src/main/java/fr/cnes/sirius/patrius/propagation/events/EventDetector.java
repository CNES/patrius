/**
 * This interface represents space-dynamics aware events detectors with support for additional
 * states.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It mirrors the {@link fr.cnes.sirius.patrius.math.ode.events.EventHandler EventHandler} interface from <a
 * href="http://commons.apache.org/math/"> commons-math</a> but provides a space-dynamics interface to the methods.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Events detectors are a useful solution to meet the requirements of propagators concerning discrete conditions. The
 * state of each event detector is queried by the integrator at each step. When the sign of the underlying g switching
 * function changes, the step is rejected and reduced, in order to make sure the sign changes occur only at steps
 * boundaries.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When step ends exactly at a switching function sign change, the corresponding event is triggered, by calling the
 * {@link #eventOccurred(SpacecraftState, boolean, boolean)} method. The method can do whatever it needs with the event
 * (logging it, performing some processing, ignore it ...). The return value of the method will be used by the
 * propagator to stop or resume propagation, possibly changing the state vector or the future event detection.
