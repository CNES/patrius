/**
 * This event detector detects the nth occurrence of an underlying event detector.
 * <p>
 * However the {@link #eventOccurred(SpacecraftState, boolean, boolean)} method is triggered at every event of the
 * underlying detector. As a result, the behaviour of this detector is the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Before and after the nth occurrence, the {@link #eventOccurred(SpacecraftState, boolean, boolean)} returns
 * Action.CONTINUE.</li>
 * <li>At the nth occurrence, the {@link #eventOccurred(SpacecraftState, boolean, boolean)} returns the user-provided
 * action.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning: </b> the {@link #eventOccurred(SpacecraftState, boolean, boolean)} method is triggered at every
 * occurrence of the underlying detector, not only at nth occurrence. Hence, overloading this detector should be
 * performed carefully: in the overloaded eventOccurred() method, the check {@link #getCurrentOccurrence()} ==
 * {@link #getOccurence()} should be performed first to ensure we are at nth occurrence before calling
 * super.eventOccurred().
 * </p>
