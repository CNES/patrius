/**
 * Barycentric Dynamic Time model.
 * <p>
 * TDB is time used to take account of time dilation when calculating orbits of planets, asteroids, comets and
 * interplanetary spacecraft in the Solar system. It was based on a Dynamical time scale but was not well defined and
 * not rigorously correct as a relativistic time scale. It was subsequently deprecated in favour of Barycentric
 * Coordinate Time (TCB), but at the 2006 General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union TDB was rehabilitated
 * by making it a specific fixed linear transformation of TCB.
