/**
 * Load and unload files for use by the readers. Buffer segments for readers.
 * <p>
 * Before a file can be read by the S/P-kernel readers, it must be loaded by loadSpkFile, which among other things,
 * loads the file into the DAF system.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Up to MAX_FILES files may be loaded for use simultaneously, and a file only has to be loaded once to become a
 * potential search target for any number of subsequent reads.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once an SPK file has been loaded, it is assigned a file handle, which is used to keep track of the file internally,
 * and which is used by the calling program to refer to the file in all subsequent calls to SPK routines.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A file may be removed from the list of files for potential searching by unloading it via a call to unloadSpkFile.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * SPKSFS performs the search for segments within a file for the S/P-kernel readers. It searches through last-loaded
 * files first. Within a single file, it searches through last-inserted segments first, thus assuming that
 * "newest data is best".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Information on loaded files is used by SPKSFS to manage a buffer of saved segment descriptors and identifiers to
 * speed up access time without having to necessarily perform file reads.
 * <p>
 * This class is based on the SPKBSR.for file of the SPICE library.
