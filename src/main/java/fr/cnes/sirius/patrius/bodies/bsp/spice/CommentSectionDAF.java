/**
 * Class dedicated to the reading of the comment section of binary DAF files.
 * 
 * A binary DAF contains an area which is reserved for storing annotations or descriptive textual information describing
 * the data contained in a file. This area is referred to as the ''comment area'' of the file. The comment area of a DAF
 * is a line oriented medium for storing textual information. The comment area preserves any leading or embedded white
 * space in the line(s) of text which are stored, so that the appearance of the of information will be unchanged when it
 * is retrieved (extracted) at some other time.
 * 
 * The class is inspired by the dafec.for file from the SPICE library.
