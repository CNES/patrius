/**
 * This class is created to define a structure to stock inertial frames, their base frame and the rotation to obtain it
 * from its base.<br>
 * It is based on the lists in the CHGIRF.for of the SPICE library.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each frame is defined in terms of another frame, except for the root frame, which is defined in terms of itself. For
 * now, the root frame is the standard IAU reference frame, J2000, defined by the Earth mean equator and dynamical
 * equinox of Julian year 2000.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each definition consists of a series of rotations, each through some angle (in arc seconds) and about some axis. The
 * rotations are listed in the opposite order in which they are to be performed, so as to correspond more closely to
 * conventional notation. For example, the definition
 *
 * <pre
 *    NAME   = 'F2'
 *    BASES  = 'F1'
 *    DEFS   = '22.34  3   31.21  2   0.449  1'
 * 
 * means that a vector in frame F1 is converted to the equivalent
 * vector in frame F2 by applying the following rotation:
 * 
 *    -                                            -
 *    v    = ( [ 22.34 ]  [ 31.21 ]  [ 0.449 ]  )  v
 *     F2               3          2          1     F1
 * 
 * where the notation
 * 
 *    [ theta ]
 *             a
 * 
 * means ``rotate through angle theta about axis a.''
 * </pre>
