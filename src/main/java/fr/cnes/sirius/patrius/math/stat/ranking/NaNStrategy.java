/**
 * Strategies for handling NaN values in rank transformations.
 * <ul>
 * <li>MINIMAL - NaNs are treated as minimal in the ordering, equivalent to (that is, tied with)
 * <code>Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</code>.</li>
 * <li>MAXIMAL - NaNs are treated as maximal in the ordering, equivalent to <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code></li>
 * <li>REMOVED - NaNs are removed before the rank transform is applied</li>
 * <li>FIXED - NaNs are left "in place," that is the rank transformation is applied to the other elements in the input
 * array, but the NaN elements are returned unchanged.</li>
 * <li>FAILED - If any NaN is encountered in the input array, an appropriate exception is thrown</li>
