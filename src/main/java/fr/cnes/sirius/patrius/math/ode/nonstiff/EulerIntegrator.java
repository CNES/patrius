/**
 * This class implements a simple Euler integrator for Ordinary
 * Differential Equations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Euler algorithm is the simplest one that can be used to integrate ordinary differential equations. It is a simple
 * inversion of the forward difference expression : <code>f'=(f(t+h)-f(t))/h</code> which leads to
 * <code>f(t+h)=f(t)+hf'</code>. The interpolation scheme used for dense output is the linear scheme already used for
 * integration.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This algorithm looks cheap because it needs only one function evaluation per step. However, as it uses linear
 * estimates, it needs very small steps to achieve high accuracy, and small steps lead to numerical errors and
 * instabilities.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is almost never used and has been included in this package only as a comparison reference for more
 * useful integrators.
