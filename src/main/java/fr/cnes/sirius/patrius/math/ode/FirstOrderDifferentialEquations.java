/**
 * This interface represents a first order differential equations set.

 * <p>
 * This interface should be implemented by all real first order differential equation problems before they can be
 * handled by the integrators {@link FirstOrderIntegrator#integrate} method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A first order differential equations problem, as seen by an integrator is the time derivative <code>dY/dt</code> of a
 * state vector <code>Y</code>, both being one dimensional arrays. From the integrator point of view, this derivative
 * depends only on the current time <code>t</code> and on the state vector <code>Y</code>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For real problems, the derivative depends also on parameters that do not belong to the state vector (dynamical model
 * constants for example). These constants are completely outside of the scope of this interface, the classes that
 * implement it are allowed to handle them as they want.
