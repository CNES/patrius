PATRIUS
Copyright 2011-2017 CNES

Historically, PATRIUS had the two following dependencies:
 - Commons-Math 3.1 (Copyright 2001-2012 The Apache Software Foundation) for Math features.
 - Orekit 5.9 (Copyright 2002-2012 CS Systèmes d'Information) for low-level space flight
 dynamics features.
Since version 4.0, these libraries have been merged into PATRIUS.
Commons-Math is now in the package fr.cnes.sirius.patrius.math.
Orekit is now merged with patrius packages in the global package
fr.cnes.sirius.patrius (see file headers for more information).
